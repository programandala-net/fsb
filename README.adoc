== Description

fsb is a preprocessor and converter of Forth source files.  Its
goal is to make it easy to edit and mantain Forth source files,
in ordinary text format, for Forth systems that use blocks
files.

Following some simple layout conventions, the source file can be
edited without the lack of space imposed by blocks, thus making
it possible to include detailed comments and arrange a clear
layout.

fsb is written as a plugin for the Vim editor.  It can be used
to edit Forth sources with the Vim editor (thus using the
included associated style and key mappings), or as a command
line tool to convert Forth source files edited with any other
editor.

fsb provides two main converters (to FB and FBS formats, as
explained below); but a set of additional, more specific
converters are included as shell files.

Project web page:
<http://programandala.net/en.program.fsb.html>.

== Requirements

The Vim editor must be installed in the system. The GUI version
(called gvim) is not required; the console version is enough.

Some converters have specific requirements. See their source
code (the files with the ".sh" filename extension).

fsb can run on any system Vim can run on, and convert files from
the FSB format to FS, FB or FBS formats (see below). But the
other converters, provided only as shell files, run only on
GNU/Linux or other flavours of Unix.

== Forth source filename extensions

The filename extensions used by fsb are derived from ".fs" and
".fb", used by Gforth and other Forth systems.

|===
| Extension | Description

| .fs | Forth stream file.
| .fsb | Forth stream file with blocks-like layout.
| .fb | Forth blocks file.
| .fbs | Forth blocks file with stream-like end-of-lines.
|===

== The FBS format

FBS is the name fsb uses for a _target format_ it can convert
FSB sources to. FBS files are blocks files but with 63-chars
lines and end of lines.  This is the format used by the library
of the lina Forth system.

== The FSB format

fsb uses an ad-hoc simple format for Forth source, called FSB.
The ".fsb" filename extension is used.  FSB files are ordinary
text files with only three simple layout conventions: block
headers, metacomments and empty lines.

=== Block headers

Block headers must be marked with a comment. There are three
ways to do it:

1. A paren comment that starts at the first column of the line.
2. A slash comment that starts at the first columen of the line
*and* ends with a second closing slash. This alternative is
provided in order to include words with closing parens.
3. A dot-paren comment that starts at the first column of the line.

In all cases, more comments or Forth code can be included after
the header comment.

Examples:

----
( Tools)

    \ this is block 0

.( More tools) \ anything is allowed here

    \ this is block 1

( MAIN-WORD ) page

    \ this is block 2

\ (CORE) \

    \ this is block 3

\ (MORE) \ by MEE on 2015-09-19

    \ this is block 4
----

The only header comment that is not necessary is the first one,
for block 0. When there is something (except metacomments, see
below) at the top of the file, it's suppossed to be the
contents of the first block.  Example:

----
\ This is block 0,
\ even without an actual block header.

: bla  ( -- )  recurse  ;

( More )

\ This is block 1.
----

=== Metacomments

Metacomments are comments that will be removed from the target
file.  They are backslash comments that are on their own line
and have at least one space on the left.

----
( block header )

\ This comment will be preserved.

variable range \ this comment will be preserved as well

  \ But all these comments
  \ will be removed
  \ from the target file.

----

=== Empty lines

All empty lines are ignored and will be removed during the
conversion.

== Directives

fsb recognizes some directives, provided they are the first word
of a backslash metacomment. Directive names start with a hash
sign. Example:

----
forth code here

  \ #directive-name directive-parameters

more forth code here
----

=== #vim

The `#vim` directive makes it possible to execute any Vim
command to preprocess the source.

----
  \ #vim any-vim-ex-command
----

Executing the `#vim` directives is the first task done by fsb.
The directives are removed from the source before executing
them, and they are executed in the order they appear in the
source.

This example is extracted from the sources of the
http://programandala.net/en.program.tron_0xf.html[Tron 0xF] game:

----
  \ The following '#vim' directives, processed by fsb,
  \ translate the UTF-8 chars in this source file to
  \ ZX Spectrum's user defined graphics.

  \ Esperanto letters:
  \ #vim %substitute@Ĉ@\=nr2char(144)@g
  \ #vim %substitute@ĉ@\=nr2char(145)@g
  \ #vim %substitute@Ĝ@\=nr2char(146)@g
  \ #vim %substitute@ĝ@\=nr2char(147)@g
  \ #vim %substitute@Ĥ@\=nr2char(148)@g
  \ #vim %substitute@ĥ@\=nr2char(149)@g
  \ #vim %substitute@Ĵ@\=nr2char(150)@g
  \ #vim %substitute@ĵ@\=nr2char(151)@g
  \ #vim %substitute@Ŝ@\=nr2char(152)@g
  \ #vim %substitute@ŝ@\=nr2char(153)@g
  \ #vim %substitute@Ŭ@\=nr2char(154)@g
  \ #vim %substitute@ŭ@\=nr2char(155)@g
----

=== #previm

The `#previm` directive works the same way than `#vim`.  The
only difference is `#previm` directives are executed first. This
makes it possible to modify the `#vim` directives with the
`#previm` directives.

=== #trace

The `#trace` directive turns the conversion tracing on: the
steps of the conversion will be saved into the <.fsb_trace>
directory. This was first intended to debug the converter, but
can be useful for detecting errors of the source layout.

== Key mappings

Some key mappings are provided in order to help during the
edition of FSB files with the Vim editor. All of them work in
the normal mode of Vim.

|===
| Shortcut | Action

| .fb | Convert the current buffer to a FB file.
| .fbs | Convert the current buffer to a FBS file.
| ,s | Toggle the FSB style (underline block headers and show a right column limit).
| ,f | Toggle the block format beetween the standard 16x64 and the alternative 32x32 (used by some 8-bit Forth systems).
| ,g | Go to the block specified as a prefix count (first block is 0).
| ,G | Go to the block specified as as prefix count, counting backwards from the end of the file (last block is 0).
| ,b | Go to the bottom of the current block.
| ,t | Go to the top of the current block.
| ,p | Go to the previous block.
| ,n | Go to the next block.
| ,<Up> | Move maximum number of valid lines up (usually 16). This is useful to calculate where a new block header is needed.
| ,<Down> | Move maximum number of valid lines down (usually 16). This is useful to calculate where a new block header is needed.
| ,c | Check the length of the current block.
| ,C | Check the length of all blocks.
| ,# | Show the number of the current block. Known issue: block 0 shows number 1.

== Converters

Several converters are provided as shell files (with the ".sh"
filename extension). They can be used from the command line,
without starting a Vim session.  Most of them are specific to ZX
Spectrum Forth systems, but may be used as a model for other
systems.

Some converters have special requirements. See their source file
for more details.

fsb-abersoft :: ZX Spectrum TAP file for the original unfixed
Abersoft Forth (one file called "DISC", with 11 1-KiB screens,
but 11263 bytes instead of 11264).

fsb-abersoft11k :: ZX Spectrum TAP file for Abersoft Forth fixed
by the Afera library (one file called "DISC", with 11 1-KiB
screens, 11264 bytes).

fsb-abersoft16k :: ZX Spectrum TAP file for Abersoft Forth
improved by the Afera library (one file called "DISC", with 16
1-KiB screens).

fsb-fb :: FB format: classic blocks file.

fsb-fbs :: FBS format: blocks file but with 63-character lines
and ends of line (the format used by the lina Forth system).

fsb-mgt :: ZX Spectrum MGT file (disk image for GDOS, G+DOS or
Beta DOS), with the Forth source saved on the sectors.

fsb-superforth :: Sinclair QL SuperForth individual block files.

fsb-tap :: ZX Spectrum TAP file (tape), for any ZX Spectrum
Forth.

As the two main conversions (fsb2fb and fsb2fbs) are done by the
Vim plugin itself, they are associated to key shortcuts.

== Install and uninstall

1. Edit <CONFIG.sh> and change the installation directories and
the installation command, if you need. Several options are
provided in commented out lines.

2. Run <INSTALL.sh>.

In order to uninstall fsb, run <UNINSTALL.sh>.

== Known issues

- The ",#" key mapping shows number 1 for block 0. This is
  caused by the simple method used to count the block headers
  above the current cursor position.

- The optional 32x32 block format has not been tested.

== fsb2

fsb has been used to develop two projects in Forth:
http://programandala.net/en.program.afera.html[Afera] and
http://programandala.net/en.program.tron_0xf.html[Tron 0xF].  It
worked great, but the development of
http://programandala.net/en.program.tron_0xf.html[Solo Forth],
with a library file of more than 400 hundreds blocks and
growing, was too much for fsb on a Raspbery Pi 2...  Then a
faster and simpler version was developed in Forth.  It's called
http://programandala.net/en.program.fsb2.html[fsb2].

fsb and fsb2 do the same: they convert the same source format
and provide the same target formats.  But there are some
differences:

- fsb2 is much faster.
- fsb2 does not provide directives.
- fsb2 does not allow comments or code at the right of a
  backslash-format block header.
- fsb2 doesn't remove the source filename extension from the
  target filename.

fsb and fsb2 can be installed at the same time.
