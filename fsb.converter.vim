" Description

" fsb is a plugin for the Vim editor. It makes it easy to edit
" Forth source, in ordinary text format, for Forth systems that
" need a blocks file.
"
" Some simple layout conventions are used to mark the start of
" Forth blocks and to make metacomments (that will be removed
" from the target blocks file, as well as empty lines).
"
" See the file <README.adoc> for full details.

" ==============================================================
" History

" See at the end of the file

" ==============================================================
" To-do

" 2015-03-25: Try the 32x32 format.
"
" 2015-03-29: Fix: a blank block is added when the last one has
" 16 lines.
"
" 2015-05-14: New: `#block` directive to mark the start of a
" block.

" Examples:
"
" / Substitute a string in the whole file:

" / Substitute a string in the definition of the word 'MYWORD':
" / #vim /\<: MYWORD\>/,/\<;\>/%substitute/Hello/Goodbye/g

" Change log

" 2015-02-12: Draft of the style commands.
"
" 2015-02-13: First version of the converters.
"
" 2015-02-14: New: Missing lines are at the end of the file and
" before every misplaced block title. Also the 'fbs' format is
" supported (Forth blocks with end of lines). Change: Renamed
" from 'fsb2fb.vim' to 'fsb.vim'. New: mappings.
"
" 2015-03-10: Change: maps.
"
" 2015-03-10: New: 'loaded_fsb' check.
"
" 2015-03-11:
"
" Fix: The program always returned '1' exit code, what made
" 'make' fail when used in a Makefile.  In order to prevent an
" error code to be returned, two fixes are done: 1) The 'e' flag
" is added to every 'substitute'.  2) 'bufloaded()' is used
" instead of a 'try' structure.
"
" Fix: The 'c' flag (accept a match at the current cursor
" position) was needed in the 'search()' function that searches
" for block titles. Otherwise empty blocks were not recognized.
"
" Fix: The 'set binary' was needed in order to make 'set
" noendofline' effective.
"
" 2015-03-14:
"
" New: Metacomments: backslash comment lines that start at the
" start of the line. They will not be included in the target.
" Now the 16-line movement ignores empty lines and metacomments.
"
" New: 'FsbCheckCurrentBlock()' checks the lenght of the current
" block and shows a message. It's mapped to a function key.
"
" New: 'FsbCheckBlocks()' checks the lenght of all blocks and
" It's called before the conversion, and also mapped to a
" function key.
"
" 2015-03-15:
"
" Change: Movement and check mappings are changed to nmemonic
" shortcuts with comma prefix.
"
" New: First support for the '#vim' directive, adapted from
" Vimclair BASIC
" (http://programandala.net/en.program.vimclair_basic.html).
"
" Change: Clearer message in'FsbCheckCurrentBlock()' when the
" lenght is valid.
"
" New: More and improved movement functions and mappings.
"
" 2015-03-15:
"
" Version A-01.
"
" Change: Now line comments at the start of the line are kept,
" while those with spaces before the backslash are considered
" metacomments and removed.  Formerly it was done the opposite
" way, but it seems more intuitive and practical this way.
"
" 2015-03-19:
"
" Fix: The algorythm of 'FsbCheckCurrentBlock()' was wrong: it
" failed at the last block because it did a comparation between
" limit lines, moving 16 lines down twice: ignoring or not the
" invalid lines.  It has been rewritten with a loop and an
" actual count of valid lines, till the next block or the end of
" the file.
"
" Change: One-letter mappings for checking.
"
" Version A-02.
"
" 2015-03-20:
"
" Change: New improved version of 'FsbVimDirectives()',  adapted
" from Vimclair BASIC
" (http://programandala.net/en.program.vimclair_basic.html):
" support for '#previm'; the directives are extracted before
" being executed.
"
" 2015-03-21:
"
" Fix: Now 'FsbTopOfBlock()' goes to the top of the file when no
" header is found. Formerly checking just the first block gave a
" wrong result, depending on the current line.
"
" Fix: The calculation of missing lines at the end of the last
" block was wrong, because the first line of a Vim file is
" number 1, not 0.
"
" Fix: It seems there's a Vim bug: `line('$')` returns +1 than
" expected, while the file (saved during the process, for
" debugging) has the expected lenght.  This added one line at
" the end of the file when the last block is 16 lines long. The
" solution was to substitute the `substitute` command with a
" loop using a modified condition. More details in the code.
"
" Version A-03.
"
" 2015-03-22:
"
" First changes to implement the support for alternative 32x32
" blocks.
"
" 2015-03-23:
"
" Fix: The calculation of missing lines at the end of the file
" failed when there was no block header line, or when it was the
" only line of the file.
"
" Version A-04.
"
" 2015-03-24:
"
" New: The steps of the conversion are saved, for debugging
" purposes.
"
" New: The alternative 32x32 format is finished. A function
" toggles the format.
"
" 2015-03-27:
"
" New: The old functions to move 16 valid lines up or down are
" restored, improved, renamed and associated to new key maps:
" `FsbMaxValidLinesUp()` and `FsbMaxValidLinesDown()`.
"
" 2015-03-30:
"
" New: Also the word `.(` is accepted as block header.
"
" 2015-04-19:
"
" Improved: After checking all blocks, the cursor position is
" restored if there was no error.
"
" 2015-05-13:
"
" Fix: Now block headers are recognized also when they are
" empty.
"
" Version A-05.
"
" 2015-05-30:
"
" Improvement: The new "#trace" directive activates the saving
" of steps. The trace directory is renamed to <.fsb_trace>.
"
" Version A-06.
"
" 2015-09-03:
"
" Added `set nomore`. Improved `s:blockHeaderExpression` to
" support two backslashes (first and last char on the header
" line), in order to make it possible to write words with
" closing parens in the block headers, e.g.  `(emit)`.
"
" Version A-07.
"
" 2015-09-19:
"
" Added `FsbBlockNumber()` to show the number of the current
" block. Added `FsbGoToBlock()` and `FsbGoToBlockFromEnd()` to
" go to a block specified by a prefix count.
"
" Version A-08.
"
" 2015-09-24:
"
" Improved the block check function: Now also the length of
" lines is checked.  Formerly that was done only during the
" conversion to FB or FBS.
"
" Version A-09.
"
" 2015-09-25:
"
" Fixed a recent typo that made `FsbBlockNumber()` fail.
"
" 2015-10-17:
"
" Little simplification of the expression hold by
" `s:blockHeaderExpression`, without practical effect.
"
" 2015-11-25:
"
" Fixed `FsbCheckCurrentBlock()`: now `strchars()` is used
" instead of `strlen()`, else lines with UTF-8 multibyte chars
" (to be translated by the correspondent directives) could cause
" a "line too long" error.
"
" Version A-10.
"
" 2015-11-27:
"
" Modified the directives' syntax: They must be in backslash
" metacomments.  So far they were recognized also in ordinary
" backslash comments, but it was no advantage, only caused
" problems: the directive lines were considered source lines
" when checking the blocks.
"
" Updated and improved the <README.adoc>.
"
" Published on GitHub.
"
" Version A-11.
"
" 2016-03-24:
"
" Fix: `l:errorFlag` was not initialized in
" `FsbCheckCurrentBlock()`, what caused error messages when
" checking an empty fake block 0 (a file header with
" metacomments).
"
" Removed trailing spaces from the source.
"
" Updated the version number after Semantic Versioning
" (http://semver.org):
"
" Version 0.11.1+20160324.
"
" 2017-01-08:
"

" Version 0.13.0+20170301.

" index lines and tabularize the list.
"
" 2018-03-26:
"
" Reorganize the columns of the list of checked blocks, for
" clarity.
